# Hi there, I'm Siddharth! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm currently studying Computer science and blockchain Technology, I am very passionate about the normalisation of the use of blockchain(other than in cryptocurrency). I am also very passionate about quantum computing. I am sure it is the next big development in the world of computers and technology. I am also very encouraged about the developments we have made in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Though contrary to belief, I don't believe that the A.I. would take away jobs or could affect us in any major way. Currently, I'm currently working on some blockchain-based projects in IoT. I am also working on a paper about quantum computing.
